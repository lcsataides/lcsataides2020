        <p>I'm Lucas Ataides, I'm 27 years old. Currently living in Bras√≠lia, Brazil.</p>
        <p>I recently graduated Graphic Design, at IESB. I've been studying front-end development by myself since then as I strive to be a more well-rounded and digital professional.</p>
        <p>I like to picture myself as a generic curator of everything: tech enthusiastic, online gaming diver and a millenial musician of course. And I do love ovo-lacto vegetarian recipes, please share yours with me: <a href="mailto:lcsataides@gmail.com">lcsataides@gmail.com</a></p>
